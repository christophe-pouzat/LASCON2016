The `HTML` files were generated with [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) of [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).\r\n\r\nThe slides of the first lecture are on the [Neurmot site](http://neuromat.numec.prp.usp.br/content/spike-sorting-what-it-why-do-we-need-it-where-does-it-come-how-it-done-how-interpret-it). The tutorial is located in file [OriginOfTheHighFrequencyExtraCellularSignal](OriginOfTheHighFrequencyExtraCellularSignal.html). \r\n\r\nFor the second and third lectures look at: [SpikeSortingTheElementaryWay](SpikeSortingTheElementaryWay.html).\r\n\r\nThe slides of the fourth lecture are available in [pdf](PouzatSaoPaulo052015.pdf). A detailed presentation of this material can be found on [hal](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01113126v2).\r\n\r\nThe tutorial of the fourth lecture is available in [html](AreTwoPSTHsIdentical.html) or as a [`Python notebook`](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/christophe-pouzat/LASCON2016/blob/master/AreTwoPSTHsIdentical.ipynb). The exhaustive description of the `Python` code used to generate the figures of the presentation is on [hal](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01224764).\r\n\r\nThe slides of the fifth lecture are on [zenodo](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18691) while the source code (with a notebook) is on [github](https://github.com/christophe-pouzat/ENP2015).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
